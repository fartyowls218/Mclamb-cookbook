	<p>My sister, Serena Jones, put together a family cookbook once upon a time. The recipes were based on hand-me-down recipes of the family as well as tried and true published recipes.  The hand-me-downs were primarily from:</p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>our mother, <a href="https://www.morrissett.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/norma-jean-mclamb-jones-obituary.jpg">Jean McLamb Jones</a></li>	
		<li>our grandmother, Lucy Pearl McLamb (Ma)</li>
		<li>our Aunt Pearl, Pearl McLamb Page</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p></p>
	<p>This is a faithful reproduction of that cookbook.</p>
